You can tap the center of the screen where it says which joystick is selected for L3/R3. You can also press volume-down on a DSi for the opposite L3/R3 button.

In addition to the on-screen buttons, you can press select or volume-up and one of the following buttons for extra options:
A: Trackpad mode
B: Hide buttons
X: Send home button when lid closed
Y: Show/hide clock
L/R: Next/previous background on top screen
UP: Send A when stylus is down (only in trackpad mode)
DOWN: Toggle bottom screen backlight
LEFT: Toggle 4-way D-Pad
Start: Home button

More custom backgrounds can be added in the nitrofiles folder, though it requires changing NUMBGs and recompiling.
